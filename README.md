This Python script automates the process of extracting and adding cultural notes to bilingual (English-Russian) Word documents. It's particularly useful for translators and linguists working on culturally specific content where context needs to be explained to a foreign audience.

Features
Batch Processing: Processes translations in batches of customizable size (default: 10 rows) for efficient handling of large datasets.
AI-Powered Analysis: Uses the OpenAI GPT model to identify and explain cultural references such as idioms, place names, events, medicines, and puns.
Progress Tracking: Displays a progress bar via tqdm to track processing status.
Customizable Output: Allows users to process a specific percentage of the document and saves the results to a new Word file.

How It Works
Input Document: The script reads a Word document containing a table with English source text and Russian translations.
Cultural Reference Extraction: For each row, it generates a prompt for the OpenAI model to identify culturally specific references and provide concise explanations in Russian.
Batch Processing: Handles the document in user-defined batch sizes to avoid rate limits and improve efficiency.
Output Document: Saves the enriched data with cultural notes in a new Word file, preserving the original table format.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Dependencies:
python-docx (for reading/writing Word documents)
openai (for AI-powered text analysis)
tqdm (for progress tracking)
Install dependencies via pip:

bash
pip install python-docx openai tqdm
Usage
Set Your OpenAI API Key: Replace the placeholder with your actual API key in the script:

python
Копировать код
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
Specify File Paths:

python
Копировать код
input_file_path = r'C:\path\to\your\input.docx'
output_file_path = r'C:\path\to\your\output.docx'
Run the Script:

bash
python script.py
Notes

Ensure you have a valid OpenAI API key.
The script uses the gpt-4o-mini model for efficiency; you can modify the model based on your requirements.
Handle your API usage carefully to avoid exceeding rate limits.

Applications
Translation projects where cultural context is essential.
Educational tools for language and cultural studies.
Localization tasks for media and entertainment content.
